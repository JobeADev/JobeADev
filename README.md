I am a driven software development student with strong problem solving skills, My numerous years of work within healthcare have deeply developed my communication and teamwork skills. I have always had a love for puzzles and the challenges that come with them, and coding has been an endless source of motivation as I find new, innovative ways to solve its challenges. 

If you're looking for someone who is a fast learner, and strives to motivate and encourage all those around him, I would love to connect!
